# Building a Node-Based Dialogue System in Unity

Creating engaging dialogue in games requires more than just good writing - it needs a robust system that can handle complex branching conversations, character relationships, and player choices. In this post, I'll walk through how I built a custom node-based dialogue editor using Unity's Graph View system.

## The Challenge

Traditional dialogue systems often rely on simple arrays or scriptable objects, which become unwieldy when dealing with:

- Multiple conversation branches
- Character-specific dialogue
- Conditional responses based on game state
- Complex dialogue trees

## Why Node-Based?

A node-based system provides several advantages:

- **Visual representation** of conversation flow
- **Easy to modify** without touching code
- **Scalable** for complex dialogue structures
- **Designer-friendly** interface

## Implementation Details

### Graph View Setup

Unity's Graph View system provides the foundation for our node-based editor:

```csharp
public class DialogueGraphView : GraphView
{
    public DialogueGraphView()
    {
        SetupZoom(ContentZoomer.DefaultMinScale, ContentZoomer.DefaultMaxScale);
        this.AddManipulator(new ContentDragger());
        this.AddManipulator(new SelectionDragger());
        this.AddManipulator(new RectangleSelector());
    }
}
```

### Custom Node Types

I created several node types to handle different dialogue elements:

- **Dialogue Node**: Contains character text and choices
- **Choice Node**: Represents player response options
- **Condition Node**: Handles branching logic
- **Event Node**: Triggers game events during dialogue

### Data Persistence

The dialogue data is serialized to JSON, making it easy to:

- Save and load conversations
- Version control dialogue changes
- Share dialogue between team members

## Results

The final system provides:

- **Intuitive visual editor** for writers and designers
- **Real-time preview** of conversation flow
- **Easy branching** for complex dialogue trees
- **Performance optimized** runtime execution

## Lessons Learned

Building this system taught me valuable lessons about:

- Unity's Graph View API limitations
- Performance optimization for large dialogue trees
- User experience design for creative tools
- Balancing flexibility with usability

## Future Improvements

Some areas I'd like to enhance:

- **Character relationship tracking**
- **Voice line integration**
- **Localization support**
- **Advanced condition system**

This dialogue system has become a core part of my game development toolkit, and I'm excited to see how it evolves in future projects.
