# Node-Based Dialogue System

A comprehensive, visual node-based dialogue system for Unity that revolutionizes how game designers and writers create branching conversations.

## Overview

This dialogue system provides a powerful, intuitive interface for creating complex narrative experiences. Built with Unity's UI Toolkit and custom node editor, it enables non-technical team members to craft engaging dialogue without touching a single line of code.

## Key Features

### Visual Node Editor

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive node creation and connection
- **Real-time Preview**: See dialogue flow as you build it
- **Multiple Node Types**: Dialogue, conditions, variables, and events
- **Auto-save**: Never lose your work with automatic saving

### Advanced Dialogue Features

- **Branching Conversations**: Complex decision trees and multiple paths
- **Variable Integration**: Dynamic text based on game state
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide dialogue based on player choices
- **Localization Ready**: Built-in support for multiple languages

### Performance Optimized

- **Memory Management**: Optimized for large dialogue databases
- **Streaming Support**: Load dialogue on-demand for open worlds

## Technical Implementation

Built using Unity's latest technologies:

- **UI Toolkit**: Modern, performant UI framework
- **Custom Node System**: Extensible architecture for new node types
- **Scriptable Objects**: Efficient data storage and serialization
- **Event System**: Decoupled architecture for easy integration

## Use Cases

Perfect for:

- **RPGs**: Complex character interactions and quest systems
- **Visual Novels**: Branching storylines and character development
- **Adventure Games**: Puzzle-based dialogue and exploration
