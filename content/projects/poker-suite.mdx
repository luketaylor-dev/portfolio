Developed and shipped a suite of **free-to-play poker and casino apps** built with **Unity**.  
These projects combined **Firebase Remote Config** and **Addressables** to support live content updates and efficient asset streaming.

Core features included:

- **Segmented IAP** flows and tailored offers to maximise ARPU
- **Seasonal pipelines** with rotating events and challenges to boost engagement
- **Cross-promotion systems** linking multiple titles in the suite for stronger retention
- Integration of **analytics and AB testing** to refine monetisation and user flows

The games scaled to large player bases and demonstrated how **game economy design**, **LiveOps tooling**, and **Unity engineering** come together to deliver sustainable, revenue-driven mobile titles.
