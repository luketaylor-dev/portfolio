As **Co-Founder and Lead Developer**, I prototyped **Baa Baa Bomber** – a comedic indie project that blends absurd humour with engaging physics-based gameplay.

Players step into the woolly boots of **Captain "Minty" Woolcock** of the Royal Sheep Air Force, tasked with bombing waves of invading evil pigeons. Each mission involves carefully timed bombing runs, bringing down pigeon fortresses with a mix of strategy, physics, and slapstick chaos.

### Gameplay Modes

- **Core Physics Campaign** – Inspired by Angry Birds, levels feature destructible structures and bombing puzzles that escalate in complexity.
- **Infinite Scroller Variant** – A fast-paced mode where players dodge obstacles and bomb pigeons endlessly for high scores.
- **EEG Integration (Experimental)** – Prototype builds included brainwave-driven inputs via BrainFlow, letting players trigger bombing actions hands-free.

### Tech & Development

- Developed in **Unity** with C#.
- **Physics-driven bombing system** for realistic trajectories and destructible environments.
- Two gameplay frameworks: puzzle-based campaign and endless arcade scroller.
- EEG integration experiments linking gameplay to real-world brainwave signals.
- Mobile-first design for iOS/Android, with a focus on free-to-play mechanics.

**Baa Baa Bomber** remains in **prototype stage**, serving as both a creative experiment in comedy-driven game design and a testbed for integrating unconventional control systems like EEG into casual mobile gameplay.
