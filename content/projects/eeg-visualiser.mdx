As **Co-Founder of Brainrave**, I helped create a system that fuses **neuroscience** and **immersive entertainment**.  
The platform captures live EEG data and translates it into dynamic visuals inside Unity, combining shader-driven effects, particle systems, and 3D brain models with reactive audio visualisation.

At its core:

- **EEG Integration** – EEG signals are streamed via **BrainFlow**, processed in Python for smoothing, band-pass filtering, and normalisation.
- **Rust Beat Detection** – A custom Rust module analyses incoming audio streams, detecting beats and onsets in real time. These events are broadcast over UDP and synchronised with the EEG signal stream.
- **Unity Visual Layer** – Unity receives both EEG and beat signals, mapping them to VFX parameters such as particle emissions, shader morphing, colour shifts, and camera motion.
- **Adaptive VFX System** – A modular adapter system allows new visual behaviours to be added quickly, from subtle waveforms to full 3D transformations.

### Why it matters

Brainrave isn’t just about visuals – it’s about **connecting brain state, emotion, and music** into one cohesive performance.  
By linking a DJ’s live set with their neural data, the project creates an **audience-facing visualisation of inner experience**, reviving live engagement in a post-COVID landscape.

### Key Features

- Real-time EEG-driven parameter mapping
- Rust-based tempo & beat tracking with millisecond accuracy
- UDP data bridge between neuroscience layer and Unity runtime
- Shader, particle, and mesh deformation effects driven by both brainwaves and audio
- Expandable VFX adapter framework for new creative behaviours
- Early prototypes designed for VR and large-scale LED wall installations

This visualiser serves as the **MVP for Brainrave**, a project I co-founded, laying the groundwork for future iterations including AI-based EEG forecasting, smart-home neurointegration, and holographic displays.
