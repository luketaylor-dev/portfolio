A **proof-of-concept virtual office** created in Unity to explore collaborative remote work in VR.  
The project combined the **Meta SDK** with **Unityâ€™s XR Interaction Toolkit** to deliver natural input handling and spatial UI.

Key features:

- Multi-user synchronisation with **Netcode for GameObjects**, supporting shared workspaces and real-time collaboration
- **Physics-based interactions** with props like whiteboards, chairs, and tools for a more tactile experience
- Early experiments with **persistent environments** to simulate longer sessions and cross-device continuity

The VR Office served as a technical exploration into how immersive environments can extend beyond entertainment and support new ways of working.
